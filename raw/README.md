# Raw Results

* Unfortunately, the cluster seemed to implode near the end of the deployment-containers phase in the raw results. So I took the missing numbers from the `deployment-containers-from-other-run` and stitched it in. The numbers from both runs were identical so it shouldn't change the results too much.
* I copied the `deployment_[metric]_results.csv` files into the other results as the "1 container" step.
* The rate limit phase was also from another run. It is detailed in the `rate-limtiters-run` directory.
